The correct address is 1440 Sachem Pl (just a different building than the one listed). There is an entrance at the ""upper level"". I've attached a fairly terrible image I've edited to show where the bus can drop off the students, who should follow the blue path to the CCRi entrance. The bus can then turn around at the circle near the end of Sachem and park over on Oak Forest Dr. We are also very close to Albemarle HS if that's more bus-friendly. I don't believe there is any place to keep the bus in Sachem Village itself.
The students will need to sign in while they're here, but we can do that in the conference room rather than creating a line at the entrance itself. Mark or I will be there to usher everyone in.",Taryn Price,taryn.price@ccri.com,434-977-0600,,,,,,,,,,,,"1422 Sachem Pl #1, Charlottesville
